# HexagonWebsite
A website for a fictional video game company called Hexagon, a competitor to Xbox and PlayStation. The website is an excercise in balancing desktop and mobile functionality and strong brand identity, while providing gaming products and services that resonate with the gaming community in a world of profit over customer.

In an alternative timeline, Samsung began working their way into the gaming console industry in the early 2010's, eventually launching the Hexagon in 2017 as a competitor to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Hexagon grew as a brand and launched their own Xbox Game Pass-like service as well as providing various helpful services.

HexPlay
A competitor to Xbox's Game Pass, HexPlay gives players a wide library to play games that come to the service. The service has a section dedicated to games with unique experiences updated each week called HexSpot, dedicated to showcasing games that innovate and stand out, or are underrated compared to bigger titles that dominate.

Hex Trial Service
Players can freely try games for a set period of time before buying them. Trials vary in time depending on the game's average playtime to beat the game and other factors such as how long specific parts of the game are.

Flexible Returns
Simular to Steam's return policy, players may return games within the same time period as the Hex Trial Service.

PC Service
All Hex games are available to play on Windows PC as well as Linux through Wine.
